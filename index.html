            <p>
              Health records are currently dominated by a paper-based phenomenon
              that is negatively impacting patient medical record accessibility
              and tracking for administrative and medical purposes.

            <p class="">
              Medical records are currently managed physically, which is
              drastically affecting compliance and causing revenue loss for the
              healthcare organization. The constantly evolving regulatory
              changes make it difficult for human efforts to keep up.

              Medical records can now be accessed on multiple devices by
              authorized medical staff and personnel, which is causing breaches
              in data and causing sensitive patient information to be misused.

              Patient records and their health information is prone to identity
              theft, wherein a third party uses the patient information to

              Data storage that is free of risks continues to be a struggle for
              healthcare organizations due to the increasing number of hacks and

              secure is therefore a pressing need.
